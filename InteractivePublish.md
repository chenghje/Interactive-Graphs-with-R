### Introduction
While interactive and dynamic visualization becomes more popular in the data science world, **RStudio** recently offers new techniques to allow users to generate the interactive graphs, either standalone or embed in a document, through `Shiny`, `ggvis` and `RMarkdown`. The interactive graph defined here is being able to take the user input for recalculation and reflect the changes accordingly with `Shiny` client-server framework heavily leveraged. Below are three simple examples I made in RStudio and then published to the web with my personal account. Please click on the <font color="blue"><u>key word</u></font> to be directed to the applications. Enjoy them and have fun!

### Example

* **Demo 1:** <u>[K-Means Clustering](https://jcheng99.shinyapps.io/k-means_clustering)</u> - choose any pairs of dimensions and how many groups you want to segment the observations. This is a standalone dynamic graph with `ShinyApp` function, posted on *shinyapps.io*.

* **Demo 2:** <u>[Distribution Smoothing](https://jcheng99.shinyapps.io/Interactive_ggvis_plot)</u> - choose the density estimation method and how smooth you want to plot the density chart. This is dynamic `ggvis` plot embed within `RMarkdwon` document, posted on *shinyapps.io*.

* **Demo 3:** <u>[Distribution Bins](https://jcheng99.shinyapps.io/InteractiveShinyApp/)</u> - choose how many bins and the distribution type you want to display the histogram chart. This is a standard `Shiny` app but embed within `RMarkdwon` document, posted on *shinyapps.io*.

### Application
We could leverage this integrated platform to develop mathematically advanced tools that excel cannot handle for internal use. The professional plan can authenticate users with password protected access for privacy and security.

### Dynamic Plot
By way of contrast, the fancy visualization without recalculation is refered as to dynamic plot. The most popular way to generate a dynamic plot is with `plotly` while some more specialized tools also available. Below are two examples. There plots are based on `htmlwidges` technique so once generated are portable html documents and independent of the platform. You can view them anywhere online or locally with an internet browser.

* **Demo 4:** <u>[Box plots](https://plotly.com/~chenghje/9/il-in-mi-oh-wi/#/)</u> - typical `plotly` graph to compare 5 groups with dynamicaly displayed data lables and adjustable size, posted on *plotly.com*.

* **Demo 5:** <u>[Time Series](https://rpubs.com/chenghje/594661)</u> - dynamic time series plot with a changable date rane, generated by `dygraph` package and posted on *RPubs* (by RStudio).

* **Demo 5:** <u>[Scatter Plot](https://rpubs.com/chenghje/594738)</u> - dynamic scatter plot with interactive toolpit, generated by`ggiraph` package and posted on *RPubs* (by RStudio).
