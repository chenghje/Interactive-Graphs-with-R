### Introduction
While interactive and dynamic visualization becomes more popular in the data science world, **RStudio** recently offers new techniques to allow users to generate the interactive graphs, either standalone or embed in a document, through `Shiny`, `ggvis` and `RMarkdown`. The interactive graph defined here is being able to take the user input for recalculation and reflect the changes accordingly with `Shiny` client-server framework heavily leveraged. Below are three simple examples made by RStudio and then published to the web with free personal account. Please click on the <font color="blue"><u>key word</u></font> to be directed to the applications. Enjoy them and have fun!

### Example
* **Demo 1:** <u>[K-Means Clustering](https://jcheng99.shinyapps.io/k-means_clustering)</u> - choose any pairs of dimensions and how many groups you want to segment the observations. This is a standalone dynamic graph with `ShinyApp` function, posted on *shinyapps.io*.

* **Demo 2:** <u>[Distribution Smoothing](https://jcheng99.shinyapps.io/Interactive_ggvis_plot)</u> - choose the density estimation method and how smooth you want to plot the density chart. This is dynamic `ggvis` plot embed within `RMarkdwon` document, posted on *shinyapps.io*.

* **Demo 3:** <u>[Distribution Bins](https://jcheng99.shinyapps.io/InteractiveShinyApp/)</u> - choose how many bins and the distribution type you want to display the histogram chart. This is a standard `Shiny` app but embed within `RMarkdwon` document, posted on *shinyapps.io*.

* **Note:** Shiny demo apps may be in the idle status when not often used with a personal account. Please be patient if it takes a moment to resume the operation in the server side.

### Statistical Application
You could leverage this integrated platform to develop mathematically advanced tools or functional dashboards that excel cannot handle for both internal use or prototyping an online analytical application. The professional plan can authenticate users with password protected access for privacy and security without idle operation status. For more information please visit the **Shiny** (by RStudio) website at the following link: <https://shiny.rstudio.com>.

### Dynamic Plot
By way of contrast, a fancy visualization without recalculation is another type of interactive graph that I usually call dynamic plot (actually the name is arbitrary and sometimes used interchangeably). A very popular way to generate dynamic plots is with `plotly` while some more specialized tools also available. These plots are based on `htmlwidgets` framework for embedding many front-end techniques (such as HTML, CSS and JavaScrips) into R automatically to to build dynamic and polished formatting. Once generated are portable html documents across platforms, so you can post them online or viem them locally with an internet browser.
Below are three simple examples. More examples can be found in **RPubs** (by RStudio) website at the following link: <https://rpubs.com>.

* **Demo 4:** <u>[Box plots](https://rpubs.com/chenghje/594826)</u> - typical `plotly` graph to compare 5 groups with dynamicaly displayed data lables and adjustable size, posted on *rpubs.com*.

* **Demo 5:** <u>[Time Series](https://rpubs.com/chenghje/594661)</u> - dynamic time series plot with a changable date rane, generated by `dygraph` package and posted on *rpubs.com*.

* **Demo 6:** <u>[Scatter Plot](https://rpubs.com/chenghje/594738)</u> - dynamic scatter plot with interactive toolpit, generated by`ggiraph` package and posted on *rpubs.com*.

* **Note:** No like Shiny applications, these posted dynamic plots can be accessed online relatively fast.

### Reporting Dashboard
Nowadays dynamic plots are very often seen in an online dashboard but building a dynamic dashboard requires more works. A dashboard can have multiple pages (themes) and each page usually include multiple graphs and tables together. Also, all the garaphs and tables in a page should be linked together so as to be changed together according to user's interactive input such as filtering the population or changing the metrics. These works can be done relatively easy with the help of BI tools (such as Tableau). Here is an example to embed an external dashboard by Google Data Studio in `RMarkdwon` document.

* **Page 1:** Cumilative mortality count, select by year
* **Page 2:** Lenth of stay view (LOS), select  by year and severity level
* **Page 3:** Mortality vs LOS scatterplot (monthly aggregation), select  by year
* **Page 4:** Monthly mortality and LOS report (bar charts), select  by year
* **Page 5:** Map for mortality count, select by state and severity level
